# Collection of data on the growth of everything

Research under Professor Robert Parham at the University of Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce.

This repository contains Python scripts developed for the automated collection and analysis of data on growth phenomena across diverse domains. The project aims to explore the prevalence and characteristics of the difference-of-log normals distribution (DLN) through statistical analysis of large datasets.
